# Survey Web Application

This project was created using [full-stack-fastapi-template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template).

## Project Setup

### Requirments
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/?ref=blog.latitude.so)

### Environment Variables

Begin by making a copy of the `.env.example` file and renaming it to `.env`.

You'll find two `.env.example` files in our project: one from root and one from frontend directory. Go through these directories and run the following to create a copy of `.env.exmaple` as `.env` file:
```
cp .env.example .env
```

The `env` file contains the configuration variables necessary for the project. You can customize the values of these variables accordingly.

> Hint: For development, you should set both `POSTGRES_USER` and`POSTGRES_PASSWORD` as `postgres`.


### Install Packages
Run the following from frontend directory:
```
npm install
```

#### Backend
Install pipx
```
pip install pipx
```
Install Poetry
```
pipx install poetry
```
Configure poetry to create virtual environment within the project folder by running:
```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
Run the following from backend directory:
```
poetry install
```

## Local Development 

### Development Setup

Start by running docker container. Run the following from the project's root directory:
```
docker compose up -d
```

Once the container is up and running, you should have following images running:
```
IMAGE                    NAMES
survey_backend:latest    survey-backend-1
adminer                  survey-adminer-1
schickling/mailcatcher   survey-mailcatcher-1
survey_frontend:latest   survey-frontend-1
postgres:12              survey-db-1
traefik:3.0              survey-proxy-1
```

You can verify by opening up Docker Desktop or running the following in terminal:
```
docker ps
```
> Hint: If you are on Windows and your backend image doesn't run and you see /app/prestart.sh: not found error, you should change your `prestart.sh` to use `LF` line endings.

> Note: You don't actually need all of these images running during development. Only `survey_backend`, `adminer` and `postgres` images are neccesary.

These are URLs hosted by docker container:
* Frontend: http://localhost
* Backend: http://localhost/api/
* Automatic Interactive Docs (Swagger UI): http://localhost/docs
* Interactive Database Manager (Adminer): http://localhost:8080
* Traefik UI: http://localhost:8090

> Hint: You can whitelist a new email address by running the following command from project root directory:
```
./scripts/whitelist-email.sh <email_address> [is_superuser]
```
### Frontend Development

Our docker container doesn't support live-update for frontend. So, you should start a local server to see the changes you make by running the following from frontend directory:
```
npm run dev
```

This will start a frontend server on `localhost:5173`. Any changes made to frontend will be visible here.

> Note: Frontend will make all API requests to base url specified as `VITE_API_URL` in frontend's `.env` file.

### Backend Development

When the docker container is up and running, any changes you make to the backend will auto-update.

Open up [Adminer](http://localhost:8080) to see interactive database manager.

Open up [Swagger](http://localhost/docs) to see interactive API.

### VS Code Debugging

To debug frontend, you simply open the **Run and Debug** panel and select **Debug Frontend**.

To debug backend, you have to set your Python Interpreter path to your virtual environment

Go to backend directory:
```
cd backend
```
Find the path to the python executable in the virtual environment by running `poetry env info --executable`

Open up your VSCode settings (**Command Palette** > **Python: Select Interpreter**) and enter the path given above. 

One this setup is complete, open the **Run and Debug** panel in Visual Studio Code and select **Debug Backend**.

You can also run both of these debuggers simultaneously by selecting **Debug Frontend and Backend**.

### Testing
